# React 
- Front end framework that lets you modulizer your views

# Redux 
- Library to help you manage your applications data // holds it in one object 
- Load in Redux from a CDN with a script tag 
- Script tag at the bottom of the page
- It's all about data, not visuals

# 4 crucial functions in Redux:

- Redux.createStore() - gets the ball rolling. uses the reducer function that takes callbacks of state and action.

- Store.getState() - provides current state of your data

- Redux.dispatch() - function that creates responds to actions that is based on a behavior or event. - ** how you trigger state changes 

- Redux.subscribe() - create callbacks that shows ** how you react to whenever the state changes

# Cycle of Redux:

- State: .subscribe()
- Views: dispatch({})
- Reducer: function(state, action){} --- causes the state to update

# Tips for Redux
- With Redux, you define a single reducer
- The reducer should define what happens to the state for any given action
- Redux will create a single State object that holds ALL of your applicationâ€™s data
- When events happen (the user does something, an AJAX call comes back, a timer
goes off, etc.), you can dispatch actions
- Redux will capture those actions and call your reducer, which tells redux what the
new state should be
- When the state changes, Redux will call all of your callbacks you subscribed
