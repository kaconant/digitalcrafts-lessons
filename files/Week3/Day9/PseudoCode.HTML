updated version from Adam:
-Get list of names from user, save the list as an array called "names"
-loop over "names"
-while "names" is not empty, do the following:
--save the first name to a variable called "currentName"
--loop over the "names" array. For each iteration, do the following:
---compare the first name to "currentName"
---if it comes before "currentName" alphabetically, replace the variable "currentName"'s value with this name
---continue this loop until compared "currentName" to each name in "names"
--At the end of this loop, "currentName" will hold the name that is first alphabetically
--print "currentName" and remove it from "names"
-After this while loop, all names will be printed alphabetically
