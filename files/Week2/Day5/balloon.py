# Exercise 2: Make your own class
# Create a class Vehicle. A Vehicle object will have 3 attributes:
# make
# model
# year
# A vehicle is created thus:

# car = Vehicle('Nissan', 'Leaf', 2015)
# And you can access itâ€™s attributes individually like so:

# >>> print car.make
# Nissan
# >>> print car.model
# Leaf
# >>> print car.year
# 2015

class Vehicle(object):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

car = Vehicle('Nissan', 'Leaf', 2015)
print car.make
print car.model
print car.year
