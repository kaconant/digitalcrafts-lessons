- Componet - reusable piece of your website
- HTML - made up of tags
- React takes that a step further and allows you to create your own tags
- State is where the data lives and props is how you get the data where it needs to go
- Props is like object of data that gets passed in, much like an html attribute
- == $0 allows you to select a tag in your console
- == $r is the component's instance (as a component is really just an object)
