# Common Interview Questions

- Fizzbuzz: Write a program that prints a number from 1 - 100. But for multiple of three print "Fizz" instead of just the number and for the multiple of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

- Fibonacci Series: A series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

- Recursive solution:
function fib(n) {
    if n(n < 2) {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n + 2)
}
